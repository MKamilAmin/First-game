# Forest-Man

[Live Game Page]()

This is my first web-based game using the canvas HTML tag and pure Javascript.

It has basic game mechanics like gravity, hitboxes and camera panning.

The motivation behind this project was to furter hone my Javascript and webpage understanding and gain further project building experience.

## I use the following types of commits:

-   `📦 NEW:` Added new functionality

-   `🐛 FIX:` Bug fixes

-   `👌 IMPROVE:` Code edits without fixing bugs or adding new features
